## Build Scripts and Repository Interaction
This project is set up using React and TypeScript, and it utilizes Vite as the build tool. Here are some common scripts you can use to interact with the repository:

- `npm run dev`: Runs the development server with hot reloading enabled.
- `npm run build`: Compiles the TypeScript code and builds the static files for production.
- `npm run preview`: Serves the built static files for previewing before deployment.

To get started with the project, clone the repository, install the dependencies using `npm install`, and then you can begin development by running `npm run dev`.
